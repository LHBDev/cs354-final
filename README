UPDATED 12/10/14 8:13 AM:
-Added file parsing
--Supports coloring of lines with format C <line number> r g b
-changed vertex class so that we can reset number, that was before adding additional scenes so no longer necessary but doesn't change functionality
- changed scenemanager so that its easier to keep track of newly added verts and lines when reading in
-files are specified on command line as arguments 
-- EX: ./final test.txt test2.txt diamond.txt
--this loads all those scenes
--can switch between scenes using right click
---all loaded scenes will be auto-populated to menu
-couldn't do object dragging because of the way elements are set up
--might work if we do a ray trace, but selection buffer didn't work

take a look at diamond.txt to see how colors are set if you want.

I'm gonna try to be up at noon. Shoot me a text then if you want to meet before class.
If you want to meet earlier feel free to call me. Might have to call a couple times to wake me up though.

MAKEFILE updates:
it's now multiplatform, and has new rules:

make
-just makes everything with -Wall

make debug
-compiles with gdb info

make run
-runs after compiling

make clean
-cleans up shit
