Didn't get around to finishing moving vertices. have clicking working but didn't push
because cOde wasn'tworking since i triedto do moving.

scene_manager.cpp has an empty loadFile function you should write.  i'll get all the
math done tonight if i can.  running kind of low on time.

once that's done, just focus on getting a right-click menu in there that we can select
parsed files from.  as long as we can pop up a bunch of models and move verts and
spin angles and shit we'll be fine.

look back through scene_manager.h, GLM integration changed a lot of things.
